I am very proud to announce that my latest song, [Find My Way](/music), has been chosen for the [Sing Together!](http://singtogether.info/) project 2020.

As with my previous songs, it will be taught to hundreds of children in schools across Lancashire and ultimately performed in a series of concerts at King George's Hall in Blackburn and Blackpool Tower.

You can also hear the song on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/find-my-way).
