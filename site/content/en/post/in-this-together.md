[![YouTube video for In This Together](/images/youtube.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcndafhJvTU)

I wrote a song about Covid 19 for a children's choir called [In This Together](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/in-this-together). It's available on streaming platforms like [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/track/0eUKzPso04naWBOOsqNkhC) and [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/gb/album/in-this-together/1520204976?i=1520204977).

You can watch the accompanying [video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcndafhJvTU) or listen to the [song on Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/in-this-together). And there's a bonus [instrumental version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ5t7iwRlUs), if you'd like to use it for your choir.
