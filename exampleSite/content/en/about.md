I am a song-writer and music teacher.

Currently Midlands-based, I was born and raised in Yorkshire, where my interest in music was cultivated.

I’ve collaborated with a diverse range of musicians, through song-writing and as a recording vocalist, featuring on several independent albums.

In 2017, my song [Open Your Eyes](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/open-your-eyes) was used as the set piece in heats of the [Last Choir Singing](http://lastchoirsinging.co.uk/) competition in Lancashire, with over 60 primary school choirs performing the song in venues such as the Blackpool Tower Ballroom.

In 2018, I collaborated with the [Royal Birmingham Conservatoire](https://www.bcu.ac.uk/conservatoire), to record my song [No More War](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/no-more-war) with a full orchestra and local children's choir.

Between 2018 and 2020, my songs [Share It](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/share-it), [Sing Together](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/sing-together) and [Find My Way](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/find-my-way) were all chosen for the repertoire of the Blackburn Cathedral [Sing Together!](http://singtogether.info/) project – a six month outreach programme that trains over 250 teachers and 3500 primary school children each year, culminating in a week of concerts at St George’s Hall in Blackburn and the Blackpool Tower.

In 2021, I was one of four artists selected to contribute to [Climate.Sound.Change](https://britishmusiccollection.org.uk/article/climate-sound-change-winners-announced), a project run by [Sound and Music](https://soundandmusic.org/) and the [British Music Collection](https://britishmusiccollection.org.uk/article/opportunity-climate-sound-change) to help raise awareness of the impact of climate change on the world. I composed a children's choir song, [Greatest Mistake](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/greatest-mistake).

I have a catalogue of songs spanning multiple genres, from Pop to Country, Opera to Latin, Rock to Christmas.
