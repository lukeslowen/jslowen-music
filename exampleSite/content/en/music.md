## Children's Choir Songs

{{< soundcloud 351452356 >}}

I want the songs I write for younger people (Key Stage 2 upwards) to be up-lifting and inspiring. Most of these songs are upbeat and explore a variety of thoughts, feelings, topics and issues. [Greatest Mistake](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/greatest-mistake?in=jslowenmusic/sets/childrens-choir-songs) was written for the Climate.Sound.Change project.

_"Your song was a triumph!"_ - [@DuncHeather](https://twitter.com/DuncHeather), international vocalist, Creative Director of Slamdunk Entertainment and host of the [Last Choir Singing](http://lastchoirsinging.co.uk) competition

_"We loved singing Open Your Eyes! We thoroughly enjoyed practising it and we'll be using for other concerts too! Thanks for writing it!"_ - [@PrimaryMrBrown](https://twitter.com/PrimaryMrBrown), Manor Road Primary School, Chorley

_"I love Open Your Eyes! - it's such a beautiful song to sing"_ - [@aimeeivy78](https://twitter.com/aimeeivy78), Shakespeare Primary School, Fleetwood

## Country

{{< soundcloud 351673961 >}}

My country songs reflect my more thoughtful, story-telling side. Songs with lots of character and narrative, one of which ([The Hard Way](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/the-hard-way?in=jslowenmusic/sets/country)) was co-written in the world-famous [Monnow Valley Studios](http://www.monnowvalleystudio.com/). They range from quiet lullabies to full-on, Nashville country rock.

## Classical Crossover

These songs are a product of my love for both the classical and pop music genres. I believe that, when combined with the beauty of the Italian language, a modern arrangement can form the most romantic type of pop song. I really enjoyed recording [Amami](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/amami?in=jslowenmusic/sets/classical-crossover) with a local tenor, but I’d love to hear [Andrea Bocelli](https://www.andreabocelli.com/) sing one of them sometime...

## Pop

A selection of my pop songs, written in different styles within a broad genre. [Alibi](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/alibi?in=jslowenmusic/sets/pop) has some Latin American rhythmic influences, whilst [Forget](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/forget?in=jslowenmusic/sets/pop) and [Pieces](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/pieces?in=jslowenmusic/sets/pop) have more of an R’n’B feel. Without You is a pop folk/ballad with a story to tell and [Burst My Bubble](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/burst-my-bubble?in=jslowenmusic/sets/pop) has all the hallmarks of bubblegum pop.

I hope you enjoy them! If you do, please feel free to comment on the tracks on my [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic) site.
