I was honoured to be awarded a grant to compose a children's choir song, [Greatest Mistake](/music), for [Climate.Sound.Change](https://britishmusiccollection.org.uk/article/climate-sound-change-winners-announced).

This is a project run by [Sound and Music](https://soundandmusic.org/) and the [British Music Collection](https://britishmusiccollection.org.uk/article/opportunity-climate-sound-change). Through musical form, the aim is to help raise awareness of the impact of climate change on the world.

I hope my song will help to educate children about this important issue.

You can also hear the song on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/greatest-mistake).
