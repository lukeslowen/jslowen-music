Celebrating their 10-year anniversary, the [Sing Together!](http://singtogether.info/) project, based in Blackburn Cathedral, has chosen my songÂ [Sing Together](/music) (apt title!) for next years concerts.

I feel very honoured to be contributing towards this fantastic educational choir project.

You can also hear the song on my [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/sing-together).
