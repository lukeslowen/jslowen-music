title: "'Open Your Eyes' sung in the Last Choir Singing heats"

---
I was privileged to hear my song, [Open Your Eyes](/music), being sung by no less than 11 school choirs at tonight's [Last Choir Singing](http://www.lastchoirsinging.co.uk/) heats at the Marine Hall, Fleetwood, Lancs.

Well done to Great Eccleston Copp School - very worthy winners of this heat. Here's me helping present the award!
