I am very honoured to have my song ['Share It'](/music) chosen as one of the set songs for the 2018 [Sing Together!](http://singtogether.info/) project, based at Blackburn Cathedral.

Over 3000 children will be learning and performing 'Share It' at King George's Hall and Blackpool Tower!

These performances will take place in January (teacher's performance), March (King George's Hall) and June 2018 (Blackpool Tower).

I can't wait to hear them!

Have a listen to the song on my [music page](/music) or on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/share-it).
