title: "'Open Your Eyes' to be used in the Last Choir Singing competition"

---
My song, Open Your Eyes, is going to be used as the set song in the [Last Choir Singing](http://lastchoirsinging.co.uk/) competition.

Over 60 primary school choirs (that’s over 400 children!) will learn the song and perform it in a series of heats across Lancashire, with the finals being held at St George’s Hall, Blackburn in March 2017.

Have a listen to the song on my [music page](/music) or on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/jslowenmusic/open-your-eyes).
